              <h4>Gabor Cseh</h4>
              <h5>Project Manager, Co-Sound Editor</h5>
              <p>Being responsible for the creative vision of project CornHub, I feel it my place to start with the original inspiration</p>
              <p>Several times during this semester I have felt my mental faculties slowing and had difficulty forcing myself to focus on the tasks at hand, but after I would enter into a heartfelt debate or discussion with a fellow student I would be mentally invigorated. Problem was, I would not know when and where my next source of intellectual conversation would come from.</p>
              <p>Enter CornHub, an app where you can choose a topic, either generated by the dev team or one of your own and find local people who are interested in discussing the same topic. Different modes would allow the user to choose to either argue for or against something or just, in general, discuss finer points of a particular subject.</p>
              <p>The conversations would be visible to other users, and when the conversation is over, the user would vote either who contributed more to the conversation and/or who won the debate. This would cause people who are well versed to gain recognition and validation in their views. The user would “level up” as they made more successful arguments, and then when it was their turn to vote, their vote would carry more weight.</p>
              <p>This project hopes to increase awareness of what topics are considered locally important, where people gather to have intellectual discussions and possible even increase the general knowledge base of the general population. It should also help facilitate people who have social anxieties about talking to people or in front of large groups, by making the user's information private. The personal information of individuals would be used to show trends to the user base, such as “75% of people between 20-30 agree that …” or “despite common belief, there is an almost 50/50 split on the debate about…”</p>
              <p>The meta information gathered about these conversations would help the users understand what their local user base considers important, and it could become a platform that authorities use to learn what topics citizens consider worth debating.</p>
              <p>In the short run, we hope to encourage people to gain an interest in research, improving social skills and come to the realization that other people around them share their views. In the long run, the goal is to have this become like the forums of old where people would gather to share important topics with their local community.</p>
              <p>There are already plenty of sites that function this way for dating and other activities, our app would be for unique in that it aims not only to entertain the user but to better them as well. I choose to lead the development in a light-hearted and comedic direction, because I find the best and most fulfilling conversations occurs when people stop watching what they’re saying for fear of offending or hurting someone, and just express their true opinion. When that happens and you’re shot down you know it was for your actual views, to a sugar coated version you're forced to express in “polite society”</p>
              <p>The 3 major influences in this project have been Pokemon Go, Tinder, and Cards against humanity. Taking a page from Pokemon Go, and forcing our users to get out there and seek local “fields of conversation” , Tinder’s minimalistic profile page and local matching and finally Cards against humanity’s freedom to express yourself with the addition of online anonymity.</p>

              <h4>Nick McCarthy</h4>
              <h5>Graphic Designer, UX Designer</h5>
              <p>Hi, my name is Nick McCarthy and I am Project Cornhub’s Graphic Designer and UX Designer. My job consisted of making the various screens that demonstrate the features of Cornhub, along with the Icon and the general artistic theme of the project. While brainstorming for our theme for our idea of creating a program to connect strangers that want to have a chat, we got on a corn idea, and once I created the logo, the idea was cemented. The logo is a piece of corn with my visual representation of soundwaves from two people talking, then a third set of soundwaves going outwards to the public. This represents our basic mechanic to our App within the logo, of allowing others to listen in to the creative discussions that happen on Cornhub. Our home screen is meant to be inviting by greeting new users with a calming cornfield and a simplistic UI meant to not overwhelm them, and giving for returning users a good feeling as they see a home screen they get more and more accustomed to over time. The map grows cornstalks as new conversations begin and new users log on. Users can tap on any stalk they please and are given the members in that conversation, the topic at hand, and are given the option to enter the viewer chat and discuss with other viewers the conversation topic. Finding other conversations and watching people discuss is entertaining, but finally when a user decides to create their own conversation, they are given a list of nearby Cornhub users with various topics, along with distance to said user, or to create their own conversation topic and find other nearby users to converse with. As each new conversation or user pops up, another stalk grows, creating a cornfield of topics to choose from. Once a user enters a chat, they are greeted with the other user on the opposite side of the screen, along with a list of watchers who are viewing the chat. Any user can tap on another user’s profile to view their other interests and add them in their contacts for future conversations. If users would like to have a physical conversation, they can follow the quick directions provided by Google Maps that runs through the app to meet the other user in person.</p>
              <p>The interface’s design is meant to be simplistic and inviting to new users, while still being warm and friendly to returning users. I decided to keep the colours revolving around yellow and green, again to represent the colours of corn, and by keeping the colour scheme simple and consistent, whenever a user sees these colours, it will remind them of using our app, subconsciously prompting them to check the app. Cornhub is meant to be a friendly and interactive user experience, helping people meet others with similar interests nearby. It helps people get outside and make some new friends, along with offering interesting conversations of many different varieties, with the overall goal of stimulating peoples brains.</p>

              <h4>Evan Lyod</h4>
              <h5>Marketing</h5>
              <p>My experience with CornHub as a whole was a bit of a roller coaster. I loved the idea immediately and I'm not necessarily the most extroverted or debate oriented person. However, I could see that it had broad appeal. People – myself included – have a difficult time finding people to talk to about various topics. Sure, just about every person has friends with similar interests, but not everyone will have the same level of enthusiasm. Then I was introduced to the name of the project.</p>
              <p>At first, I loved the name. It made me laugh and was easy enough to remember. However, the more I thought about how I had to market this product the more problematic the name became in my mind. People were going to assume this was a pornographic website focused on corn of all things – or worse, people weren't going to think it was a real product. All I'll say is that I'm glad this is a group project, as when I brought up these concerns to the rest of the group, my mind was flipped like a switch and I was back on board when I was introduced to the pun potential – or “puntential” – and that the general idea that they had for how to market CornHub was through comedy.</p>
              <p>People enjoy companies that don't seem to take themselves too seriously – at least in terms of their advertisements. Take Old Spice for example. This company has been around for nearly eighty years, but their sales had a significant jump with the release of the The Man Your Man Can Smell Like ad campaign. Even today – nearly seven years later – people will quote those commercials ad nauseam because comedy strikes a chord with people. It's easily remembered and something that the average person feels the need to share. This was something that we were willing and able to utilize to our advantage.</p>
              <p>The intense and ever-changing nature of the viral market can be somewhat of a double-edged sword, that is for sure. It will drive people by the millions to a specific location, but then interest will just as quickly die off. With a product like CornHub, that will not be a problem. Say the first commercial goes viral and off of that popularity we're able to ship out a decent amount of units. Unlike other products, our advertising does not end when the campaign does. People begin wearing the wristbands and going out into the world using our product. Others will see our product, ask what our product is, and that's another potential customer. Word of mouth will keep our sales going strong even when our initial ad campaign is over.</p>
              <p>The change in culture will make now a better time than ever to release a product like this into the world. Things that just a decade ago may have been considered geeky or weird are now commonplace in pop culture. One of the main reasons for this their prevalence in the media. D&D was once something people did in basements with close friends, but now people will gladly participate in and speak about D&amp;D in a much more public setting. CornHub will likely speed this process up for other similarly taboo hobbies. As people find others who enjoy the same topics as they do with the same intensity, they will be less likely to be ashamed of these pastimes and generally happier.</p>
              <p>Easy to explain, easy to market, easy to use, and with ample room to grow and add new features in future versions. It will likely become a staple in terms of wearable technology and help bring people together. All in all, it is an amazing idea that will end up practically selling itself. It was my job to help give it that initial push to get the ball rolling.</p>

              <h4>Martin Boote</h4>
              <h5>Asset Producer</h5>
              <p>My name is Martin Boote, and I am the Asset Producer for CornHub. My main role thus far has been designing the companion bracelet for the app. The purpose of this bracelet is to facilitate the near field function of the app, allowing a user to find people in person who are running the app.</p>
              <p>The body of the final bracelet will be made of a silicone skin cast over a pair of spring-hardened steel wire rods in a ‘C’ shape. These steel bones will allow the bracelet to be worn without a clasp mechanism, while still being able to resist falling off. The inside of band will be slightly ribbed, further preventing slipping. The silicone body of the bracelet will keep the internals of the bracelet safe from the elements.</p>
      	      <p>The internals of the bracelet will consist of a small computing unit, a Bluetooth unit, a charging module, and batteries. The internal modules are separated to allow for greater flexibility. The charging module could either be micro-USB based or induction based. Induction charging would allow for the bracelet to be entirely waterproof, as there would be no openings in the silicone skin. A micro-USB based charging system would be more convenient overall, as most modern portable devices are charged via micro-USB. Having an opening for the port would reduce overall waterproofness, however as a trade-off, it would greatly increase the battery life of the device. A micro-USB based charging solution also opens he possibility of having a bracelet battery extension module.</p>
      	      <p>There are small peg holes around the outside of the band. The prototype has four, this could easily be expanded. These holes are for the addition of buttons, which would translate into the game. The point of these is a social one: they are designed as a way for fans of the platform to express themselves as such in the real world. For example, the buttons could be based on achievements or badges earned through discussion. This will be a great opportunity for those members who wish to identify themselves instead of remaining anonymous. For those who do want to remain anonymous, there will be more general badges.</p>
      	      <p>Anonymity is an important part of this application in terms of demographic data gathering, which is a key part of this platform. My secondary role in this project so far is the development of avatar customization. The costumes I’ve developed so far are all based on famous and important debaters. So far, I’ve done: Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States, who’s leadership lead to the abolishment of slavery in the Union, and after the civil war, the entire country; Thomas Huxley, a strong academic supporter of Darwin’s theory of evolution, and was key to the development of scientific schooling in Europe; and Socrates, an ancient Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Western philosophy. These three were chosen for all being fairly different people, and representing different ways of thinking, while all being incredibly influential in their fields.</p>

              <h4>Trenton Pottruff</h4>
              <h5>Web Developer, Programmer</h5>
              <p>My name is Trenton Pottruff, and I am the lead software engineer and video editor for the CornHub project. I am fully responsible for the development and maintenance of the website and the app itself. Anything involving the technical side of things, and I am involved with it.</p>
              <p>On the creative side of things, I was responsible for assembling and effectively designed the very layout and look for the Project CornHub web page. I was also heavily involved with the development of the CornHub name, originally pitching the name. I contributed to the discussion on the development of how the name CornHub relates the the app and how to integrate corn related themes into the app. I designed the text portion of the CornHub logo as well.</p>
              <p>My other major responsibility involved working on the promotional video. I had the honour of providing voice talent for promotion. In this process, I provided a lot of creativity towards the theme and feel of the promotional video, especially in my voice acting. Adding on to this, I added a very “specific” theme of music on to the video. This theme overall ties into the theme of the website as a sort of nod to the reference that the name is making. After all the appropriate assets were gathered together, I was responsible for editing and exporting the video as well as uploading the video and incorporating it into the web page.</p>
              <p>I am very proud of the work that we have all accomplished here at the CornHub project and the app that we have developed. I firmly believe that CornHub’s ability to make conversing with others around you about whatever topic you choose, is a service that many people need and may enjoy. I personally feel that CornHub could revolutionize the way we debate important topics. CornHub potentially could become a platform that is heavily used during election periods to debate certain topics and issues that politicians and candidates bring up on the campaign trail. The ability for users to vote on things like conversation contribution and who “won” the debate could hopefully shape our opinions on certain topics and encourage others to hone their debate skills so that they become effective at conveying their opinions. Since the apps very foundation discourages negative conversation, users will have no other choice but to become skilled debaters, and that itself should contribute to a much better society. For example, you can’t just rant on and on calling other in the conversation by hateful names, you would be rewarded for remaining calm and being convincing about your opinion.</p>
              <p>Overall, I serve the purpose of being the one who brings all of our teams great ideas into one combined project. Without me, CornHub would simply be an idea without a website or a promotional video. This kind of pressure is quite stressful, but I enjoy what I do. After all, this entire app is about being passionate about what you do and what you believe in. And that’s what really matters.</p>
